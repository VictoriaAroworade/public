# ADD NEW ORGANIZATIONS AND CONTACTS

## Step 1: Access `Data Import Wizard`

![Data Import Wizard](migration_method/data_import_wizard.jpg)

## Step 2: Add New Organizations and Contacts

### (1) Select `Organisations and Contacts` Object in Import Wizard

![Add New Organizations and Contacts Example](migration_method/add_new_orgs_contacts_example.jpg) \##### FOR Which Object holds the new records that will be added. (`Organizations` OR `Contacts`)

### (2) Select `None`:

##### FOR Match Contact by AND Match Account by

### (3) Check and Select: `Trigger workflow rules and processes`

### (4) Input `CSV file` with character code `UTF8`

## Step 3: Field Mapping

![Field Mapping for Organizations Example](migration_method/field_mapping_orgs_example.jpg)

### (1) Review Mapping

### (2) Map Salesforce Object `Organisation: Organisation Name` to `Organisation Name` in `csv header`

## Step 4: Start Import

# ADD NEW RECORDS

##### All `records` must be added to their respective `Assay`, `Instrument`, `Software` objects prior to creating any `Packages` which link these respective records to one another.

## Step 1: Access `Data Import Wizard`

![Data Import Wizard](migration_method/data_import_wizard.jpg)

## Step 2: Add New Records `Assay` `Instrument` `Software`

### (1) Select Object in Import Wizard

![Add New Records for Assays Example](migration_method/add_new_records_assay_example.jpg)

##### FOR Which Object holds the new records that will be added. (`Assay`, `Instrument` OR `Software`)

### (2) Select `Salesforce.com ID`:

##### FOR Which Organisation field in your file specifies the Master/Detail relationship

### (3) Check and Select: `Trigger workflow rules and processes`

### (4) Input `CSV file` with character code `UTF8`

## Step 3: Field Mapping

![Field Mapping for Assays Example](migration_method/field_mapping_assays_example.jpg)

### (1) Review Mapping

### (2) Map Salesforce Object `Company/Institution Name` to `Organisation ID` in `csv header`

### Important Considerations:

###### (1) Fields are auto-mapped to existing Salesforce fields. Ensure that all column headers in your import file maps exactly to field labels in `Salesforce.com`

###### (2) Review all mapped fields in order to ensure no failed imports -OR- import of incorrect data into `Salesforce.com`

##### (3) Salesforce has a limitation of `90 mapped fields` per data import

###### (4) Best practice: leave fields unmapped that you do not want to import. DO NOT map `Organisation Name` in `csv header`

###### (5) Best practice: Remove all `empty columns` from data set meaning columns in which there is no gathered data (e.g. `Other` columns)

## Step 4: Start Import

![Start Import for Assays Example](migration_method/start_import_assays_example.jpg)

### Important Considerations:

###### (1) Salesforce will review import and reject any imports that do not qualify for import. Please access `error` files via email sent by `Salesforce` vs. `results.csv` file in `Data Import Wizard`

###### (2) Remember to Quality Check Data following Import

# ADD NEW TEST DIRECTORY PACKAGES

##### All `records` must be added to a `Test Directory Package` which allows for the linkage between `Assay`, `Instrument` and `Software` as necessary.

## Step 1: Access `Data Import Wizard`

![Data Import Wizard](migration_method/data_import_wizard.jpg)

## Step 2: Add New Test Directory Packages

### (1) Select Object in Import Wizard

![Add New Records for Test Directory Packages Example](migration_method/add_new_packages_example.jpg)

### (2) Select `Salesforce.com ID`:

![Selecting Salesforce.com ID Example](migration_method/add_new_packages_example_2.jpg)

###### FOR Which Object field in your file specifies the Master/Detail relationship. Map based on which `unique IDs` you have in your import file.

### (3) Check and Select: `Trigger workflow rules and processes`

### (4) Input `CSV file` with character code `UTF8`

## Step 3: Field Mapping

![Field Mapping for Packages Example](migration_method/field_mapping_packages_example.jpg)

### (1) Review Mapping

### (2) Map Salesforce Objects to CSV Headers

#### `Assay` to `Assay ID`, `Instrument` to `Instrument ID`, `Software` to `Software ID` as needed.

## Step 4: Start Import

![Start Import for Packages Example](migration_method/start_import_packages_example.jpg)

### Important Considerations:

###### (1) `Packages` must be created after `all records` are created that are needed in a package and never prior.

###### (2) `Packages` must be created irregardless of whether there is a linkage needed between `Assay`, `Instrument` and `Software` objects.

###### (3) To link objects between eachother the `unique IDs` must be available in the `assay`, `instrument`, `software` ID columns as needed.

###### (4) Best practice: Do not map object `unique IDs` if they are not needed in your file and remove the `empty ID columns` from file

# ADD NEW PERFORMANCE DETAIL SUBMISSION RECORDS

##### All `records` must be added to their respective `Test Directory Packages`

## Step 1: Access `Data Import Wizard`

![Data Import Wizard](migration_method/data_import_wizard.jpg)

## Step 2: Add New Records `Performance Detail Submissions`

### (1) Select Object in Import Wizard

![Add New Performance Records for Packages and ASI Objects Example](migration_method/add_new_performance_records_example.jpg)

##### FOR Which Object holds the new records that will be added. (`Test Directory Packages`)

### (2) Select `Salesforce.com ID`:

![Add New Records for Performance Detail Submissions](migration_method/add_new_perf_packages.jpg)

###### FOR Which Test Directory Package field, Assay, Instrument, Software field + Technology Submission field in your file specifies the Master/Detail relationship. Map based on which `unique IDs` you would like to add performance detail submissions to.

### (3) Check and Select: `Trigger workflow rules and processes`

### (4) Input `CSV file` with character code `UTF8`

## Step 3: Field Mapping

![Field Mapping for Performance Records Example](migration_method/field_mapping_add_performance.jpg)

### (1) Review Mapping

### (2) Map Salesforce Object `Package` to `Package ID` in `csv header`

### (3) Map Salesforce Objects as needed to `Assay` `Instrument` `Software` to `Assay ID` `Instrument ID` `Software ID` to `csv header`

### Important Considerations:

###### (1) Populate all lookup fields `Assay` `Instrument` and/or `Software` for objects in your file to allow for lookups that are needed for Performance Detail Submissions

###### (2) Always include `Test Directory Packages` in migration along with the necessary objects to add into Salesforce

###### (3) Always add `Performance Detail Submissions` in migration even if there is no current performance to add in the database

###### (4) Best practice: Remove all `empty columns` from data set meaning columns in which there is no gathered data (e.g. `Other` columns)

## Step 4: Start Import

# REPORTS

## Step 1: Report Needed for Migration

#### (1) Organizations Report

This report consists of all new organizations to be added to the database needed for the subsequent addition of records. Data must be cross-verified with existing Organization data in `Salesforce Production`, prior to creating new organizations.

![Organizations Report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VictoriaAroworade/Victoria_A_Document_Share/public_va/add_new_performance_records_2.jpg)

#### (2) Organizations with `Assays` , `Instruments` `Software`

This report consists of all `Organization IDs` mapped to the new ASI records to be added. Correct mapping of Organization ID must be verified prior to import of data into Production.

![Organizations Report](migration_method/field_mapping_add_performance.jpg)

#### (3) Test Directory Report for `Packages`

This report consists of all `ASI IDs` which will be used to create the Package in which the `ASI` record will lie.

![Organizations Report](migration_method/field_mapping_add_performance.jpg)

#### (4) Test Directory Report with Performance for `Packages`

This report consists of `Package IDs` plus the necessary `ASI IDs` in which to add performance detail records,

![Organizations Report](migration_method/field_mapping_add_performance.jpg)

## Step 2: Report Needed for Quality Control

#### (1) Test Directory `Developer` Organizations Report

#### (2) Test Directory `Developer` Report for `Assays`, `Instrument`, `Software`

#### (3) Test Directory `Developer` Report with Performance for `Packages`

### Important Considerations:

###### (1) Ensure `no duplicate data` is added to Salesforce Production (e.g. `Organizations, ASI or performance`)

###### (2) Ensure data aligns correctly (`via unique IDs`), tests are mapped to the correct `organizations`, `ASI` and `performance details`

###### (3) Ensure data aligns/maps correctly to the correct fields/values of `migrated landscape`

###### (4) Ensure `complete data` for mandatory fields (e.g., unknowns/not applicables, zero's inputted for unknown numerical data)

###### (5) Ensure `packages` are created for all `ASI` added to the database

###### (6) Ensure `Sense-checking` of migrated data is completed prior to migration into production. (e.g. matching data fields in different objects are aligned and corresponding fields are aligned)

###### (7) Ensure data is quality checked by `migrator` following `production` migration
